Python for Cybersecurity Automation



This repository documents my journey to mastering Python, focusing on its application in cybersecurity automation. Starting from the basics, I aim to build a solid foundation and gradually advance to implementing Python-based solutions for real-world cybersecurity challenges. This repository will include my notes, exercises, scripts, and projects as I progress.

Goals

Master Python Fundamentals: Begin with the core concepts of Python programming to ensure a strong understanding of its syntax and structure.

Apply Python to Cybersecurity: Develop and implement scripts for tasks such as:
Vulnerability scanning
Log analysis
Network monitoring
Automating security workflows

Document My Learning: Share progress through clear and structured examples for others to learn alongside me.
